# neuriteX
A collection of functions to evaluate the integrity of nerve cell processes (neurites) in microscopy images

## Description
For neurons modified with a fluorescent cytoplasmic marker, a score is computed that reflects the integrity of all neurites (axons and dendrites). The code is primarily intended for research labs in academia and industry that study neurodegeneration. The codebase is written in Python (version 3.6.7, 3.7.9) and R (version 4.4.1) and has been tested in Windows 10.

Image analysis is implemented in Python and includes: image correction; neurite segmentation with computation of the neurite integrity index (NII); and generation of images representing processing intermediates (for parameter optimization).<br />
Result visualization is implemented in R.<br />
<br />
For the provided step-by-step guide, knowledge of Python and R is required, as well as familiarity with the use of IDEs (PyCharm and R Studio).  ImageJ (or Fiji) is helpful for evaluation of generated image stacks.<br />


## Analysis â€“ first steps

-	Download repository from https://github.com/pmeran/neuriteX/ and extract locally
-	In PyCharm, create new root folder named 'neuriteX_root_folder/'
-	From downloaded repository, transfer folder `img_ori/` and file `neuriteX.py` to root folder
-	Open `neuriteX.py` in PyCharm
-	Run `neuriteX.py` code from first line all the way down to `END OF METHODS`
-	Move to section `# 1. Single image analysis` and find the following line of code:<br />
  `path_main = '<path_main>/neuriteX_root_folder/'`<br />
  then replace `<path_main>` with absolute path for root folder<br />

## 1. Single image analysis

**Summary**<br />

To get familiar with the analysis pipeline, it is recommended to first analyze single original images (provided in folder `img_ori`) by running code section `# 1. Single image analysis` in `neuriteX.py`.<br /><br />
Images are analyzed with two segmentation filters. The first filter identifies pixels corresponding to peaks in cross-sectional intensity profiles. These pixels pass the second filter if - based on examination of their local surroundings - they represent neurites (curvilinear structures) but not blebs (small spherical or elliptical structures).<br />
A raw numerical score `N_perc` (for neurite percent) is calculated as the percentage of pixels passing the 2nd filter (neurites) versus pixels passing the 1st filter (peaks). `N_perc` can be retrieved from output dictionary `D` as `D['N_perc']`, returned by functions `nX_segmentation_test` and `nX_segmentation`.<br /><br />

Details for modules in section `#1. Single image analysis` in `neuriteX.py`:<br />
- **1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Display image**<br />
Read and display image from folder `img_ori/`<br /><br />
- **1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Image correction**<br />
Reduce noise, adjust brightness, add gamma correction<br /><br />
Function:<br />
`imgC, status = nX_correction(imgX, promMin = 5, perc_hi = 95, lim_I_new = 200, gamma = 0.8, win = 3, ord = 2)`<br /><br />
Returns:<br />
`imgC`	corrected output image<br />
`status`	returns 1 if correct, or error code -1 if input image has no detectable structures<br /><br />
Parameters:<br />
`imgX`	input image (numpy array, 1196 x 1196, np.uint8)<br />
`promMin`	minimum peak prominence<br />
`perc_hi`	percentile of detected peak intensities to use as input intensity pivot for brightness adjustment<br />
`lim_I_new`	output intensity pivot for brightness adjustment<br />
`gamma`	gamma correction parameter <br />
`win`	window size for Savitzky-Golay noise reduction<br />
`ord`	order for Savitzky-Golay noise reduction<br /><br />
- **1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Image segmentation and generation of test images**<br />
Generate neurite integrity score, create images of intermediate processing states<br /><br />
Function:<br />
`D, stack = nX_segmentation_test (imgC, img_file, ptUL=(10,10), eH=100, extF = 3, win = 3, ord=2, t = 100000)`<br /><br />
Returns:<br />
`D`	dictionary with output `N_perc`, the percentage of neurite pixels among all peak pixels<br />
`stack`	stack of images representing various stages of analysis (for parameter adjustments)<br /><br />
Parameters:<br />
`imgC`	(corrected) input image (numpy array, 1196 x 1196, np.uint8)<br />
`img_file`	filename of original image<br />
`ptUL`	upper left anchor of image area to be analyzed<br />
`eH`	half edge length of image area to be analyzed<br />
`extF`	scaling factor for analysis<br />
`win`	window size for Savitzky-Golay noise reduction<br />
`ord`	order for Savitzky-Golay noise reduction<br />
`t`	number of peak pixels to be selected randomly for image analysis<br /><br />
- **1.4&nbsp;&nbsp;Image segmentation**<br />
Generate neurite integrity score<br /><br />
Function:<br />
`D = nX_segmentation (imgC, img_file, ptUL=(10,10), eH=100, extF=3, win=3, ord=2, t=100000)`<br /><br />
Function `nX_segmentation` is largely identical to function `nX_segmentation_test`, with the difference that the former does not return `stack`. `nX_segmentation` is therefore faster and is used for batch processing.<br />
<br /><br />

## 2. Batch analysis of multiple images

**Summary**<br />
Neurodegeneration experiments require comparison of multiple conditions set up in multiplicates. We therefore implemented processing of images in match mode, and both code and sample images are provided for a batch analysis test run.<br />
Folder `img_ori` contains sample images from a neurodegeneration experiment involing axotomy. The provided images represent two conditions ('uncut', 'cut'), 3 scenes (i.e. imaging areas) per condition, and 7 acquisition time points for each scene, resulting in a total of 2 * 3 * 7 = 42 images. Spreadsheet `df_excel.xlsx` lists all images and their relation to scenes, conditions, and time points. Since the spreadsheet can get quite complex for larger experiments, and is an integral part for creating charts, it should be generated programmatically, as shown (code section `Create excel spreadsheet` in file `neuriteX.py`).<br /><br />
Code for batch image processing is given in sections `#2.1 Batch processing - image correction` and  `#2.2 Batch processing - image segmentation`. Both modules make use of the same functions used for single image processing.<br /><br />
Image segmentation (functions `nX_segmentation` and `nX_segmentation_test`) is very time intensive, posing challenges for parameter optimization, and resulting in very long run times.<br />
To facilitate parameter optimization, both segmentation functions (`nX_segmentation` and `nX_segmentation_test`) offer the option to minimize the analyzed image area (by tweaking parameters `pUL` = upper left corner, and `eH` = half edge of image area to be analyzed). As a result, setting `eH = 100` takes about 15 seconds; while `eH = 580` takes about 6 minutes to complete.<br />
Parallelization, as implemented, considerably expedites computation. To cope with run times of several hours, we successfully ran the code without major tweaks on a Linux compute cluster (sample scripts are given in folder `src_cluster`).<br /><br />
Batch processing generates a raw neurite integrity score `N_perc` for each image, and stores values in in file `df_seg.pkl`.<br /><br />
